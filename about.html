                    <p><em> Q. What cameras did you use to take these photos? </em></p>
                    <p> A. All of the pictures on this website were taken with the Fuji Cardia Joy Date. </p>
                    <p><em> Q. What type of film do you use? </em></p>
                    <p> A. Kodak Gold, mostly. (I might have used Ultramax for some of the older photos, but I don't remember). </p>
                    <p><em> Q. Where are you from? </em></p>
                    <p> A. Portland, Oregon. </p>
                    <p><em> Q. How did you get into film photography? </em></p>
                    <p> A. I bought my one (and so far only) film camera off of Depop in 2020 during the pandemic. 
                        I had used disposable cameras for years before that and thought that it was time to invest in the real thing. 
                        I'm glad I did! </p>
                    <p><em> Q. What are your favorite places to get film developed? </em></p>
                    <p> A. <a href="http://www.lusterphoto.com/" target="_blank">Luster</a> (New York City) and <a href="https://www.theshutterbug.com/" target="_blank">The Shutterbug</a> (Portland, Oregon). </p>
                    <p><em> Q. I noticed that there aren't any pictures from 2022 on this website, but the homepage says that this is supposed to chronicle your college years from 2022-2025. </em></p>
                    <p> A. Good catch! I didn't bring my camera with me to my first semester of college, so there are no pictures from the Fall 2022 semester. </p>
                    <p><em> Q. What is the point of this website? </em></p>
                    <p> A. To let me look back on my college years with fondness, I hope. </p>
                    <p><em> Q. Why is film photography better than digital photography? </em></p>
                    <p> A. Why is water wet? Haha, just kidding everyone. </p>
